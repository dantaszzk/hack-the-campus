# CTF Hack the Campus – School Portal
## ℹ️ Description

This is a fictional school portal designed for educational training/CTF.
It simulates a complete school environment, with several realistic pages and features, but the entire site runs in the browser, without a backend. Data is simulated using static JSON and localStorage.

The final objective is the Challenge page, where you must enter the correct flag to complete the CTF and receive a reward (a client-side generated .txt certificate, brazilian project, fictitious certificate for educational purposes only).

 Warning: This challenge is educational. Do not use these techniques on real websites without permission. ⚠️

## 🎯Portal Features

The portal contains several pages with simulated features:

• Home:
with school name, news carousel, and quick links to all pages.

• Courses:
Filterable list of courses, cards with descriptions, teacher, tags, and a simulated registration button.

Grid with teacher profiles, attendance calendar, and a button to schedule simulated meetings.

## 🔍 Important Tip

The secret is **hidden within the website code itself**.
You may need to use **DevTools (F12)**, inspect elements, HTML comments, or `data-*` attributes to discover the flag.

⚠️ No real attack is necessary. Everything can be solved **with just analysis and curiosity**.
